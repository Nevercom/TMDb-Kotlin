TheMovieDatabase  API wrapper for Kotlin

I'd like to introduce this API wrapper for The Movie Database which I've created for Android applications in the first place using Kotlin and Kotlin CoroutinesÂ´,
but it can be used in any Gradle project.

I've written a detailed documentation with all nexessary info in form of a GitHub page which can be found here: https://vkay94.github.io/TMDb-Kotlin
